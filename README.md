# Happiness API - Web Computing Assignment 1

This project was developed during my second year, second semester at QUT.

## To get running

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## About

This project is non-functional after the completion of the unit as QUT provided the API to access the world happiness data. 

### Purpose

This is a React based web application, it allows the users to conveniently access and use the happiness survey data from an external database that is exposed using a REST API. 
This web application supplies the information from the REST API in an aesthetic and functional form for the user to manipulate and read.

While trivial the application also provides authentication using jwt tokens to access authenticated routes from the API.
